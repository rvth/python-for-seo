Hello! 

This is a small collection of beginner friendly python scripts for performing data analysis for the purpose of SEO. Please read [this article](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/7-example-projects-to-get-started-with-python-for-seo/389336/) to find out more.

If you have any questions or would like some data to play around with, please feel free to reach out to me via email - ruth.everett@deepcrawl.com or on twitter [@rvtheverett](https://twitter.com/rvtheverett)
